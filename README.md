With thys system you can use 6 stones in weapons and armours but you maybe know something:

-You need adapt sockets for your offline shop.
-If you use Rarity System you need adapt this system (iBeast).
-I don't test for using +7-+10 stones so, maybe give weird bugs.
-If you use Guild Storage, others specials inventorys, on you save items, you need adapt system.
-Is old but working, i only test in local server around 2015-2017 so i don't know problems in db or with many players or bugs.
-With more code, you can use stones in others elements, like shields, etc.
